Player;Yes:Sure, I'd love to. I'm $Name$.:character,Octavia Blake|Player|15:scene,Map1;No:No thanks, I'll pass.:line,8:character,Octavia Blake|Player|-5;true

Octavia Blake;And do you have a problem with that?<She takes a step closer, her first balled up like she's ready to fight you.>;0,1.12,0
Player;Yes:Yeah, I do. You're an illegal child, who was using up our oxgyen and probably the reason we're even down here.:line,19:character,Octavia Blake|Player|-15:character,Bellamy Blake|Player|-5;No:No, I'm just stating facts. I like being honest. Sorry if it offended you:line,29:character,Octavia Blake|Player|5;true

Player;Yes:Beats dying down here:line,39:character,Octavia Blake|Player|-5;No:Nope, dying down here sounds better. At least I can be drunk and having fun while I do it:line,33Octavia Blake|Player|5;true

Octavia Blake; I get it, you're as spoiled as the chancellor's son and that little blonde princess. Goodbye.<She begins to walk away.>;0,1.12,0
Player;Let her walk away: :scene,Map1;Grab her arm and apologize:Look, I'm really sorry. I'm just not the best at making friends and I didn't know a good thing to say:line,13:character,Octavia Blake|Player|5;true
